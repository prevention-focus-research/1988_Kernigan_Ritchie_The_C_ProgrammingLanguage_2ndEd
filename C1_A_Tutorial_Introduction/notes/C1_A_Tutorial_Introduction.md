## 1.1: GETTING STARTED

Let's do the 'Hello, World!' program with the ANSI C programming language!

```c
#include <stdio.h>

main()
{
    printf("hello, world\n");
}
```

Running the program is system-dependent. On Unix, one creates a file ending wiht `".c"`, such as *hello.c*, then compile the program with the following command line statement:

```
$ cc hello.c
```

The compilation proceeds silently by default if the program did not err during compilation. The result of successful compilation is the executable named *a.out*. To run the executable, one executes the following statement on the command line:

```
$ a.out
```

When *a.out* is executed, the following is output to the console:

```
hello, world
```

### A CLOSER LOOK AT THE PROGRAM

A C program, regardless of size consists of *functions* and *varibles*. A function contains *statements* that specify the computing operations to be done, and variables store values used during the computation. C functions are like the subroutines and function of 'Fortran' or the procedures and functions of 'Pascal'. Our example is a function named `main`. There is generally flexibility in functoin naming; however, `main` is special. One's program begins executing at the beginning of `main`. This means that every program must have a `main` somewhere.

`main` usually calls other functions -- either user-defined, or from provided libraries.

`#include <stdio.h>` located at line one of the *hello.c* program tells the compiler to include the information about the standard input/output library; this line appears at the beginning of many C source files. The standard library is described in *C7* and *Appendix B*. 

One approach to communicating data between functions is for the calling function to provide a list of values, called *arguments*, to the function it calls. The parentheses after the function name surrounds the argument list. In this example, `main` is defined to be a function that expects no arguments, which is indicated by the empty list `()`. 

The statements of a function are enclosed in braces `{}`. The function `main` contains only one statement:

```c
    printf("hello, world\n");
```

A function is called by naming it, followed by a parenthesized list of arguments, so this calls the function `printf` with the argument `"hello, world\n"`. `printf` is a library function that prints output, in this case the string of characters between the quotes. 

A sequence of characters in double quots, like `"hello, world"`, is called a *character string* or *string constant*. For the moment our only use of character strings will be as arguments for `printf` and other functions.

The sequence `\n` in the string is 'C' notation for the *newline character*, which when printed advances the output to the left margin on the next line. If one leavs out the `\n` (a worthwhile experiment), one will find that there is noline advance after the output is printed. One must use the `\n` to include a newline character in the `printf` argument; 

If one tries something like this:

```c
    printf("hello, world
    ");
```

the C compiler will produce an error message!

`printf` never supplies a newline automatically, so several calls may be used to build up an output line in stages. Our first program could just as well hve been written:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

main()
{
    printf("hello, ");
    printf("world");
    printf("\n");
}
```

to produce identical output.

Notice that `\n` represents only a single character. An *escape sequence* like `\n` provides a general and extensible mechanism for representing hard-to-type or invisible characters. Among the others C provides include `\t` for tab, `\b` for backspace, `\"` for the double quote, and `\\` for the backslash itself. There is a complete list in 'Section 2.3'.

**Exercise 1-1**: Run the "hello, world" program on one's system. Experiement with leaving out parts of the program to see which error messages are produced.

The following program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

main()
{
    printf("hello, world\n")
}
```

produced the following error:
```
/src/ex1_1.c:7:1: warning: return type defaults to ‘int’ [-Wimplicit-int]
    7 | main()
      | ^~~~
/src/ex1_1.c: In function ‘main’:
/src/ex1_1.c:9:29: error: expected ‘;’ before ‘}’ token
    9 |     printf("hello, world\n")
      |                             ^
      |                             ;
   10 | }
      | ~    
```

**Exercise 1-2**: Experiment to find out what happens when `printf`'s argument string contains `\c`, where *c* is some character not listed above.

The following program:
```c

```

produced the following warning:
```
Starting build...
/usr/bin/gcc -fdiagnostics-color=always -g src/ex1_2.c -o src/../exec/ex1_2.out
src/ex1_2.c: In function ‘main’:
src/ex1_2.c:8:12: warning: unknown escape sequence: '\c'
    8 |     printf("hello, wor\cld\n");
      |            ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Build finished with warning(s).
```

and the following output:

```
hello, worcld
```
